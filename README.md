## Project Information

In this project, we assess genomic, epigenomic, and functional genomic characteristics of the HT-22 Mouse Hippocampal Neuronal Cell Line.

### Experiments we conducted include: 

* Karyotype
* Illumina short-read whole-genome sequencing
* PacBio HiFi long-read whole-genome sequencing
* Illumina PolyA RNA sequencing
* PacBio Long-Read RNA Iso-Seq
* Illumina ATAC-sequencing of HT-22 cell line
* Illumina Hi-C sequencing of HT-22 cell line

### Raw Data

We have deposited our raw sequencing data in SRA under our NCBI BioProject at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA938057
